"""The RunPod Serverless worker for One Percent.

One job in, one drafted reply out. Ollama runs beside this process inside the same
container and is never reachable from outside it, so there is no address to protect and no
token to check at this layer -- RunPod's own key is what gates the endpoint.

The model is baked into the image rather than pulled at boot. A cold start already costs
tens of seconds; downloading a model on top of that would put every first draft past any
budget worth having.
