// Work the operator owes somebody.

// Everything else on a record is work the client owes themselves: the path, the steps under it,

// hundred dollars for a rate card, pays it, and the quote reads agreed and paid while nothing
// anywhere says whether the rate card was ever written.
//
// A paid quote with no project against it is money taken for something nobody is tracking, and
// the record says so rather than leaving it to be noticed.
